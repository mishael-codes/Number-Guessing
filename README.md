## About
This is a project which would help me to get a portfolio-worthy project. It is a site which has lots and lots of games to play(for now, it has just three) as a means of de-stressing, relaxation or just for fun.

This project gave me a better idea of how the DOM works, accessing, manipulating, styling and updating HTML elements with the DOM. I also affected the control flow using conditionals.

Building this project also brought me much joy as I completed major parts of it **without following a tutorial!**ðŸ˜€

### Guess The Number

#### **_ How To Play _**
 When the game loads, a random number is selected by the computer.
 
 For each respective level, you have a specific number of guesses. Once you exhaust it, it's game over.
 
 Enter a number within the specified range and click on the "Guess" button to make a guess.
 
 Depending on your guess, you will be told if you need to guess higher, guess lower or if you got the number right.
 
 If you got the number right, click on next to generate another number.
 
#### **_ Hints _**

 **BH(Basic Hints):** This gives hints to get the number based on basic math knowlegde like division and multiplication.
 
 **RH(Rhyme Hints):** This gives hints to get the number by showing you words that rhyme with the required number.
 
 **Solve:** As the name implies, this solves the questions for you by entering the required number in the input field. All you have to do is click "Guess".
