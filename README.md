# The Min Game Hub
This is a project which would help me to get a portfolio-worthy project. It is a site which has lots and lots of games to play(for now, it has just one) as a means of de-stressing, relaxation or just for fun.

This project gave me a better idea of how the DOM works, accessing, manipulating, styling and updating HTML elements with the DOM.
Building this project also brought me much joy as I completed one of the games without following a tutorial!ðŸ˜€
